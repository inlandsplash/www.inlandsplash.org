## About the Riverside Aquettes  
Riverside Aquettes was founded in May 1958 and was affiliated with the YMCA.  The affiliation with the “Y” was ended when the “Y” building was sold and the pool was no longer available.  In November, 1966 incorporation papers were filed with the State of California and the Riverside Aquettes became a non-profit corporation. The Riverside Aquettes is more than just a sports club.  The organization is dedicated to the development of community and business leadership skills in its members through competition in the sport of synchronized swimming.  It works to provide a strong community focus with the intention of developing in its athlete’s self-esteem, a sense of responsibility to their community and the leadership skills that will allow them to make a difference.  The club stresses physical fitness, teamwork, leadership, self-discipline, a high standard of moral values and the ideals of good sportsmanship.  

The success of the Riverside Aquettes is due to our General Manager and Head Coach, Sue Nesbitt. She comes to us after a very successful competitive career, including eighteen national championships and fourteen international titles including gold medals in the Pan Am Games and two World Games.  She served as an Olympic Coach for Australia for the 1984 Olympic Games and continues to train international synchronized swimmers and coaches here in Riverside.  In 1995, she earned the title of U.S. National Coach.  The United States Olympic Committee named Sue its Developmental Coach of the Year three times.  

The mission of the Riverside Aquettes is to produce high-caliber, successful and goal-oriented young people through a synchronized swimming curriculum which emphasizes the development of technical, physical and mental ability, the integration of creative movement to music, and cooperative functioning as a team member.  

## RAQ Program Offerings  

### Synchro Lites Classes  
Each Summer we hold a program for anyone who would like to try synchronized swimming.  Swimmers ages six and older, who are comfortable in deep water are welcome.  The classes continue throughout the year.  Our focus is on swimming skills and basic synchronized swimming skills.  

### Synchro Lites 2  
This is an introduction to competitive synchronized swimming where the swimmers compete at the novice and intermediate levels at competitions in the local area.  

### Competitive Program  
Swimmers are admitted to the competitive program in late summer or early fall as they meet the requirements and space is available.  Swimmers are grouped in teams of approximately eight girls each.  Teams are divided by age and ability, with the actual grouping depending upon the number of swimmers in the club.  The age of a swimmer is determined by her birth year.  Subtract the birth year from the competitive year to determine the swimmers competitive age.  

### Masters Program
Anyone over the age of 18 can join this fun group for $5 per session.  We learn all the basics of synchro and for those who are interested, we do a competition at the end of the year.
